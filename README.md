# Awesome 3D Engine List

This is a list of 3D Engine related papers and code resources.  It focuses on game engine resources, mostly
on recent material.

# Beginning material
* [Thinking about writing a game engine, where do I start?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/30pcl6/thinking_about_writing_game_engine_where_do_i/) - Reddit thread that has lots of useful info.
* [Learn Computer Graphics From Scratch!](http://www.scratchapixel.com/)

# Books
* [Game Engine Architecture, Second Edition by Jason Gregory](https://www.amazon.com/Engine-Architecture-Second-Jason-Gregory-ebook/dp/B00MMOJ076/)
* [Books by David H. Eberly](https://www.amazon.com/David-H.-Eberly/e/B001IQW5L2/) - Eberly has written a number of books about 3D Engines and 3D Physics.
* [Real-Time 3D Rendering with DirectX and HLSL by Paul Varcholik](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Rendering-DirectX-HLSL-Programming-ebook/dp/B00K3NR6OC) - Windows only. 
* [Designing a Modern Rendering Engine (PDF)](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2007/bauchinger-2007-mre/bauchinger-2007-mre-Thesis.pdf) - Thesis from 2007 so somewhat dated, but good starting point (and free).
